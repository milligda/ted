## Overview

A community approach for finding, sharing, and commenting on TED Talks.  When the home page loads, new Talks are scraped using Cheerio and stored with MongoDB and Mongoose.  

Talks can then be favorited by the Community and viewed on the Community Favorites page.  People can leave comments on the Talks, but the community can remove inappropriate comments.
